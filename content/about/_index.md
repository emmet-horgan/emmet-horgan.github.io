Hi ! I'm Emmet, a Software Engineer from Cork, Ireland. 

This website is mainly for my blog posts which will mostly be some of my ramblings in the area of signal processing, programming, natural languages or whatever I am currently interested in. 

The main reason I made this site is because I have always enjoyed note taking and creating a nice document that explains a solution to a problem I have been having or a topic that I have been studying. The problem with that is up to now, all those documents essentially go to waste so I thought that sharing them on a platform like this would be a nice incentive for me (even if no one reads) and also light a small fire under my ass to ensure that the information is mostly correct.
